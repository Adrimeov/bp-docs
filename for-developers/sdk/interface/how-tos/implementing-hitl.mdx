title: Implementing Human in the loop (HITL) in an integration
---

import { CurrentInterfaceVersion } from '/snippets/interface-version.mdx'

The Human in the loop (HITL) interface allows you to implement human agent intervention in your integration.

## Terminology

Throughout this document, we will use the following terms:

- **Integration**: The code that connects Botpress to an external service.
- **External service**: The service that provides HITL functionality. This could be a help desk system like Zendesk, or any other system that allows human agents to send and receive messages to end users.
- **Human agent**: A person who interacts with end users through the external service. This could be a support agent, a sales representative, or any other type of human agent.
- **End user**: A person who interacts with your bot through Botpress. This could be a customer, a user, an employee, or any other type of end user.
- **External user**: A representation of a end user within the external service. This is typically created when a HITL session is started.
- **HITL session**: A conversation between an end user and a human agent. This is typically represented as a _ticket_ in the external service.
- **HITL interface**: The interface that defines the contract for implementing HITL functionality in your integration. This interface specifies the actions, events, and channels that your integration must implement to support HITL.
- **HITL plugin**: The Botpress plugin that manages HITL sessions and relays messages between end users and your integration. Installing this plugin in a bot enables HITL functionality using the selected integration.

## External service requirements

The external service providing HITL functionality **must** support the following:

- An API that allows creating external users.
- An API that allows creating HITL sessions.
- An API that allows adding messages to HITL sessions.
- An API that allows closing HITL sessions.
- Webhooks that can notify your integration of the following events:
  - HITL session closure.
  - Human agent assignment.
  - Human agent reply.

## Updating your `package.json` file

### Finding the current interface version

The current version of the `hitl` interface is: <code>^<CurrentInterfaceVersion interfaceName="hitl" fallback="0.4.0" /></code>

You will need this version number for the next steps.

### Adding the interface as a dependency

Once you have the interface version, you can add it as a dependency to your integration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the package.json file">
    Open your integration's `package.json` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the bpDependencies section">
    If there is no `bpDependencies` section in your integration's `package.json` file, create one:
    ```json package.json {2}
    {
      "bpDependencies": {}
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the interface as a dependency">
    In the `bpDependencies` section, add the interface as a dependency. For example, for version `0.4.0`, you would add the following:
    ```json package.json {3}
    {
      "bpDependencies": {
        "hitl": "interface:hitl@^0.4.0"
      }
    }
    ```
    <Warning>
    It is very important to follow this syntax: <br/>
    `"<interface-name>": "interface:<interface-name>@<version>"`.
    </Warning>
    <Tip>
    Interface versions use a numbering system with three parts: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (like `1.2.3`). When adding an interface to your integration, we recommend using the caret symbol (`^`) before the version number (like `^0.4.0`). This tells the Botpress CLI to automatically use newer compatible versions when they're available.

    For example, if you specify `^0.4.0` as the version:
    - You'll automatically get updates like `0.4.6` or `0.5.0` (bug fixes and new features).
    - You won't get version `1.0.0` (which might break your integration).
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the package.json file">
    Save the `package.json` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the interface">
  Now that you have added the interface as a dependency, you can run the [`bp add`](/for-developers/cli/commands/add) command to install it. This command will:
  - Download the interface from Botpress.
  - Install it in a directory named `bp_modules` in your integration's root directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding a helper build script

To keep your integration up to date, we recommend adding a helper build script to your integration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the package.json file">
    Open your integration's `package.json` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the build script">
    In the `scripts` section, add the following script:
    ```json package.json {3}
    {
      "scripts": {
        "build": "bp add -y && bp build"
      }
    }
    ```
    <Note>
    If the `build` script already exists in your `package.json` file, please replace it.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the package.json file">
    Save the `package.json` file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now, whenever you run `npm run build`, it will automatically install the interface and build your integration. This is useful for ensuring that your integration is always up to date with the latest version of the interface.

## Editing your integration definition file

### Adding the interface to your integration definition file

Now that the interface is installed, you must add it your integration definition file in order to implement it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the integration.definition.ts file">
    Open your integration's `integration.definition.ts` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import the interface">
    At the top of the file, import the interface:
    ```typescript integration.definition.ts
    import hitl from './bp_modules/hitl'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extend your definition">
  Use the `.extend()` function at the end of your `new IntegrationDefinition()` statement:
  ```typescript integration.definition.ts {4-6}
  export default new sdk.IntegrationDefinition({
    ...
  })
    .extend(hitl, () => ({
      entities: {},
    }))
  ```
  The exact syntax of `.extend()` will be explained in the next section.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuring the interface

The `.extend()` function takes two arguments:

- The first argument is a reference to the interface you want to implement. In this case, it is `hitl`.
- The second argument is a configuration object. Using this object, you can override interface defaults with custom names, titles, and descriptions.

<Tip>
Whilst renaming actions, events and channels is optional, it is highly recommended to rename these to match the terminology of the external service. This will help you avoid confusion and make your integration easier to understand.
</Tip>

#### Renaming actions

The `hitl` interface defines three actions that are used to interact with the external service:

- `createUser` - Used by the HITL plugin to request the creation of a user in the external service and on Botpress.
- `startHitl` - Used by the HITL plugin to request the creation of a HITL session in the external service.
- `stopHitl` - Used by the HITL plugin to request the closure of a HITL session in the external service.

If you want to rename these actions, you can do so in the configuration object. For example, if you want to rename `createUser` to `hitlCreateUser`, you can do it like this:

```typescript integration.definition.ts {4}
.extend(hitl, () => ({
  actions: {
    createUser: {
      name: 'hitlCreateUser',
    },
  },
}))
```

<Tip>
For example, if you're using a _help desk_ system like Zendesk, JIRA Service Desk, or Freshdesk for HITL functionality, you might rename `startHitl` to `createTicket` and `stopHitl` to `closeTicket`. These systems use tickets to represent help requests, so renaming actions to match their terminology makes your integration clearer and easier to understand.
</Tip>

#### Renaming events

The `hitl` interface defines these events to notify the plugin of changes in the external service:

- `hitlAssigned` - Emitted by your integration to notify the HITL plugin that a human agent has been assigned to a HITL session.
- `hitlStopped` - Emitted by your integration to notify the HITL plugin that a HITL session has been closed.

If you want to rename these events, you can do so in the configuration object. For example, if you want to rename `hitlAssigned` to `agentAssigned`, you can do it like this:

```typescript integration.definition.ts {4}
.extend(hitl, () => ({
  events: {
    hitlAssigned: {
      name: 'agentAssigned',
    },
  },
}))
```

#### Renaming channels

The `hitl` interface defines these channels:

- `hitl` - Used by the HITL plugin to send and receive messages from the external service. This represents the communication channel for the HITL session, like a support ticket on Zendesk or a direct message thread on Slack.

If you want to rename this channel, you can do so in the configuration object. For example, if you want to rename `hitl` to `supportTicket`, you can do it like this:

```typescript integration.definition.ts {4}
.extend(hitl, () => ({
  channels: {
    hitl: {
      name: 'supportTicket',
    },
  },
}))
```
